# Create New Programming Assignment

Your goal is to generate a new homework assignment for the Mergington High School students.

## Step 1: Gather Assignment Information

If not already provided by the user, ask what the assignment will be about.

## Step 2: Create Assignment Structure

1. Create a new directory in the `assignments` folder with a unique name based on the assignment topic
1. Create a new file in the directory named `README.md` with the structure from the [assignment-template.md](../../templates/assignment-template.md) file
1. Fill out the assignment details in the README file
1. (Optional) Add starter code or attachments if the assignment needs them - add these files to the same assignment folder

## Step 3: Update Website Configuration

Update the assignments list in [config.json](../../config.json) website configuration file to include the new assignment. For the dueDate field, use the current date plus 7 days unless specified otherwise.
